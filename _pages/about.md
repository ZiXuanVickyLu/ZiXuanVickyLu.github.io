I’m a first year Phd student at University of Utah, School of computing, advised by Prof. [Yin Yang](https://yangzzzy.github.io/). 
I finished my master degree at ISCAS, co-advised by Prof. [Xiaowei He](http://peridynamics.com/), Xuehui Liu, and Xueyang Zhu. My research interests include high-performance computation and its application in computer graphics, especially physics-based animation.

Before graduation study, I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from University of Chinese Academy of Science in July, 2021.

Here is my [[cv]](/files/resume_en_ZixuanLu.pdf).
