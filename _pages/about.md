I’m a second year master student at ISCAS, advised by Prof. [Xiaowei He](http://peridynamics.com/) and Xuehui Liu. My research interests include high-performance computation and its application in computer graphics, especially physics-based animation.

Before graduation study, I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from University of Chinese Academy of Science in July, 2021.

Here is my [[cv]](/files/resume_en_ZixuanLu.pdf).
